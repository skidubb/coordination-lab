The go/no-go gate requires (a) all-in cost confirmation within acceptable ROI parameters, (b) evidence of at least $3M-$5M in additional addressable government pipeline beyond the $2M contract, and (c) a positive signal from the government buyer (letter of intent, shortlist confirmation, or equivalent). If the gate is passed, Phase 2 activates with scaled engineering resources, a selected FedRAMP consultant/3PAO, and a revolving credit facility to manage cash flow. The CFO establishes quarterly ROI reporting to the board, and the CEO begins marketing FedRAMP readiness to enterprise and government prospects. A hard stop-loss at 15% of annual cash runway triggers an automatic board review before additional spending is authorized. Post-certification, Phase 3 focuses on compliance maintenance budgeting and active pipeline monetization to validate the long-term asset thesis."
