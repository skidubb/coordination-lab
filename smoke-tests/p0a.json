Red/Blue/White Team simultaneously stress-tests the pursue/defer/reject positions through adversarial reasoning, surfaces hidden assumptions about certification timelines and resource costs, and identifies decision-critical unknowns. The protocol's strength is crystallizing what evidence would actually change the decision, enabling efficient next steps.",
